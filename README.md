Classes for easier arc rotation

Setup:

Drop the .sc (class) files in your supercollider class folder or symlink them.

For OSX:

/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/SCClassLibrary

Leave the .scd out of the class directory. You can open it from a project folder or wherever you find appropriate.

See ArcUsage.scd for further setup.
