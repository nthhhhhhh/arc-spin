Classes for easier arc rotation

Setup:

Drop the .sc (class) files and .schelp (documentation) files in their respective directories.

For OSX:

Class folder:
/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/SCClassLibrary

Leave the .scd out of the class directory. You can open it from a project folder or wherever you find appropriate.

One can find the help folder to drop the .schelp file in the directory:
/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/HelpSource/Classes

See ArcUsage.scd for further setup.
